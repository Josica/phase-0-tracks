# Git Definitions

**Instructions:** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful?**
Version Control is the management of keeping a software project that has multiple versions well organized over time. It is useful because one can revert back to older versions if necessary it also keeps people accountable for different changes.
* **What is a branch and why would you use one?**
A branch is simply a lightweight movable pointer for a commit. I would use branches because this lets us have the ability to work on different features and sections while keeping the main project clear of bugs. 

* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**
A commit is a save point for the changes you are making in your code. A good commit message can help people find out why a particular change was made to the code or why a specific feature was added.
* **What is a merge conflict?**
A merge conflict is when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged. That is, you have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa.
