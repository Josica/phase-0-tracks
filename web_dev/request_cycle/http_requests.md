A GET request requests data from a specified resource, while a POST request submits data to be processed to a specified resource. You can use a GET request to retrieve html, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. POST requests are most commonly sent by web forms. 

* **What is a cookie? How does it relate to HTTP requests?**
Cookies are small files which are stored on a user's computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer. Cookies came in to formation because prior to it we had to use a form with a hidden field containing a token or to pass the token as part of the URLâ€™s query string to know if two requests came from the same browser.
